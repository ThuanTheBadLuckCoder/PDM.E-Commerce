<h1> E-COMMERCE PLATFORM </h1>

# üöÄ About the Project

With the E-commerce platform we will build, consumers can register and log in as a member of the brand. The basic e-commerce platform should have clear display and concise product descriptions and intuitive search and filtering options. In addition, customer support is really important, the platform should provide multiple channels of customer support, including email, phone, and chat, to help customers with their orders or address any issues they may encounter. The platform should allow customers to leave reviews and ratings of products to help other customers make informed purchasing decisions.
